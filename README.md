In this project, we demonstrated the process of analyzing cricket data using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. We explored the steps of data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries. Finally, we have obtained the top 11 players by analyzing their data. We integrated the analyzed data into Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. With this knowledge, cricket teams, analysts, and enthusiasts can leverage data analysis techniques to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions in the world of cricket.
